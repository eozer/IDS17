anoth review mention this charger put out 15 0v in agm mode and that s too mani volt for some agm batteri and it caus his to outga reduc the batteri s life my optima yellow top agm batteri is rate for 15v charg so i thought this charger would be okay for it but the charger i got put out 15 5v i did find spec that say 15 6v regul voltag is okay for rapid charg on my batteri but they don defin what rapid charg mean they do say with 15 6v to charg until current drop below 1 amp which i think mean you can do 15 6v until the batteri get closer to be charg and stop accept high amperag unfortun this charger doe the exact opposit start at lower voltag and increas to 15 5v around when it decid the batteri is at 90 charg which seem to equat to about 12 6 or 12 7v on my batteri the charger keep output 15 5v until the batteri is fulli charg which may take hour so it seem unlik that s good for most batteri and i m pretti sure it s against the charg spec on my batteri note that the charger show 15 4v on it readout but my volt meter show it s actual 15 5v nevertheless i let it keep do 15 5v and check period to make sure the batteri wasn hot it never even felt warm and an ir temperatur gun read 86f max and wasn hiss hiss would mean it was overcharg and releas gas perman reduc it life it took almost exact 12 hour for the charger to decid it was 100 charg and go into mainten mode but when it did it pick 12 4v agm batteri are suppos to be charg at around 13 6v for mainten float charg so i have no idea whi it pick 12 4v i left it on for anoth hour and it actual reduc the voltag to 12 3 at which point i took it off the charger volt meter said the batteri was at 12 31v i can decid if this charger is broken has weird charg algorithm or is actual veri smart i say that becaus my batteri was discharg to about 3 5v few week ago well below the voltag it s design to be discharg to it s deep cycl but even deep cycl don toler discharg below 50 and even below 10 5v may hurt them so it s now damag and won hold the full 13 6v it s suppos to instead if i leav it on the charger at 15 5v for an hour it hit 12 8v and then quick lose charg to 12 5v in about 30 minut so mayb the charger somehow figur that out and decid that 12 4v was full charg on my damag batteri so that s what it use as it float charg i don see how it could determin that if the batteri was 12 8v or higher after the long 15 5v charg but who know i also don know if 15 4v is realli bad for my batteri or for the averag agm i spent awhil research but couldn find ani real authorit inform just bunch of peopl theoriz sinc it s abov the 15v standard charg on the batteri spec sheet i don think it s good thing but then again i also found research nrel dot gov vehiclesandfuel energystorag pdfs evs17pr pdf show that serious overvolt yellow top batteri to 17v under certain condit actual increas it life so i don know what to think but i m lean toward think it s bad thing to go against the manufactur s spec sheet unless you re in lab use special charger what i do know is that the desulfin featur on this charger didn do thing for my damag batteri in fact i don think it even kick in i connect the charger to small seal lead acid batteri that i left unus for too long and it went into desulfin mode i think the manual doesn say how you re suppos to know for over 8 hour pump 16 8v into the batteri until it said bad bat on it screen and stop charg in all that time the batteri never show over 15 charg on the charger though it did end up hold about 10 9v in my onlin research it was mention in few place that there are no studi show desulfin actual work so i m pretti dubious about it it definit didn work on either of my batteri it was also interest to note that the seal lead acid batteri never got warm which i find rather curious consid how long it was put in such high voltag i had the charger connect to kill watt meter and it show the charger was pull onli 0 15amp and 9watt and this is in 2amp charg mode so mayb the charger is smart enough to use low amperag when it s use high voltag and that prevent the batteri from get damag when it was push 15 4v to my agm batteri it was onli draw 0 35amp and it actual reduc the amp to 0 29 as it got closer to 100 charg so mayb that protect the batteri from overvoltag damag but i don know enough to be sure mayb batteri expert will chime in in the comment anoth import thing to consid is that desulfin mode could damag your car s electron if you don remov the batteri from the car to charg it 16 8v is more than most car were design to handl and i found someon mention that bmw warn not to use charger that do thing like that so it s definit concern i don know if i feel comfort use this charger again without remov the batteri from the car some charger claim to somehow magic detect the presenc of car electron and limit their voltag but this charger say noth about that in it manual other than all that the design of the charger is nice wire fit into pocket beneath the retract handl it will show you the batteri voltag on it readout until you tell it to start charg although it read 0 1 to 0 2v lower than my volt meter which is annoy button let you toggl between display of voltag or batteri percent it let you choos standard agm and gel cell and choos from three rate of charg the slower 2a charg rate is suppos to be better for mani batteri so use 2a or 6a if you aren in hurri i tri both those mode and it still put out 15 5v in 6a mode but it put out 15 3v in 2a mode sinc this is dedic 12v charger you don have to worri about it autodetect actual auto misdetect your discharg 12v batteri as 6v and never charg it past 6v which is problem with far too mani charger these day despit it nice control and smart form factor i give this charger low rate becaus i think it tri to push some batteri beyond their limit in the name of charg them as quick or as fulli as possibl one review said it caus his agm to outga and anoth said it burnt out his batteri after few month of trickl charg mode if you have the right brand of batteri that can handl this charger s output and your batteri isn damag it s probabl fine but the fact that it can damag thing and may even damag car electron in desulfin mode strike me as veri bad design especi given that desulfin seem like more of market ploy than valuabl featur i also don like that it volt meter read

first this is good product if you want to tint your tail light on budget howev there are mani drawback to use this product pros afford altern to otherwis time consum tint or opt to take it to cost shop to have it done right when done correct you may achiev good result howev do this job correct may take some knowledg with paint color sand and other prep work relat to bodi work con easi to mess up by mess up i mean get run from spray too wet close nobodi like the run doe not hide imperfect easi to appli too much when you think you still might want them littl darker there realli are no instruct on the can do not expect the can to tell you what to do what not to do from my experi with this or ani product i can howev give some general rule of thumb tip some will still have their drawback this is how i did it you will need dawn dish soap origin formula not the newer ultra concentr spray bottl at least 1 2 are better latex or equival glove 2000 grit wet sand paper run alcohol 50 50 water mix water obvious mask tape solid flat surfac to work on qualiti light qualiti ventil and the vht clearcoat of cours final lot of patienc option meguiar ultim compound microfib towel dual action polish soft buff polish pad step 1 i remov my tail light no sens tri to spray them on the vehicl unless you want to spend all of the time to mask it off correct at which point you would have them off by now anyway step 2 put latex or vinyl glove on you d be amaz at how much oil your hand are produc and believ me it will effect your overal qualiti of work i follow up my soapi water wash with 50 50 alcohol water mix for final prep prior to sand i thorough clean the tail light with good old fashion regular dawn dish soap and warm water follow by rins off sound cheap you d be surpris how far back the origin formula dawn dish soap has been util in the bodi industri it is great degreas step 3 put new pair of glove on don want to get waterlog or have water run out of them step 4 mask anyth on the light that you don want spray ie inner edg revers light whatev i wet sand my tail light with 2000 grit sand paper and anoth solut of dawn water via spray bottl keep the paper surfac wet make sure you sand the entir surfac uniform and with mild pressur don tri dig yourself through the other end of these light we will get to the reason whi i myself chose the 2000 grit and noth more abras or noth at all littl later on step 5 rins off your headlight light towel dri them and inspect let them dri complet they will appear haze foggi ani spot that you miss or didn scuff up enough will retain it s origin gloss and should be correct prior to advanc to the next step step 6 onc you are satisfi with your wet sand i recommend follow up with anoth mist via spray bottl of 50 50 water rub alcohol to be certain that the tail light are free of ani dust greas particl prior to paint it never hurt to be safe and by the time you are done do all of this work you will either thank yourself in the end or curs yourself for not take that one last just in case effort step 7 appli light uniform coat of the vht night shade spray tint i appli my first coat at distanc around 8 12 maintain some level of overlap to assur uniform coverag i recommend anyth from 25 overlap min to 50 overlap max spray the edg first work quick yet take your time if that make sens depend on humid and temperatur i would let the first coat sit for bare minimum of 10 minut befor appli ani addit coat if it cool or humid wait about 15 minut don fall into the urg of touch the surfac to check whether or not it feel dri to touch especi if you ever plan to use your tail light for commit crime your print will be etch into them and forens will be all over it step 8 let it dri dri dri i recommend wait bare minimum of 45 minut to an hour befor clear coat you do not want to let the clear coat blend into the paint this might be overkil but if you clear too soon your light will look dull cloudi step 9 appli clear coat some peopl recommend as much as 4 coat 6 light coat whatev you desir basic clear coat is littl bit differ you should spray it on wet enough to assur you don have dri littl speck all over yet it is veri easi to get it to run you have alreadi gotten this far without mess up so just like paint take your time spray the first coat on light follow up with one mayb even 2 wetter coat i think anyth more than 3 general coat is overkil step 10 let it dri dri dri no it s not readi to be touch yet let it dri for as long as possibl befor handl i would recommend let it dri no less than few hour befor handl just to be safe if possibl let it dri for at least 6 hour befor re instal them on your vehicl if it is go to rain later on that day night i would recommend just instal them the next day option there are 3 possibl here you are either finish at this point if so congratul on job well done or you can continu on to the step or you have made mistak and are not satisfi if you have made mistak swallow your pride and let these thing dri for as long as possibl befor attempt to follow all of the step over again if go the sand rout aceton goo gone or whatev you might consid use work great when the product is still in it out gass cure stage if you would go the quick fix method where time is money step 11 you may have notic orang peel littl bump all over the place don worri you didn do anyth wrong this is entir normal with clear coat this can be correct veri easili by let the light dri for no less than 24 hour imo and gentl onc again wet sand the clear coat smooth with 2000 grit wet sandpap same soapi water mix light pressur work littl at time and squeegi work great for wipe off residu to show you how much work you have left to do step 12 so you are all smooth and now your work surfac look like crap darn he got me all this work and now it s all hazi mess up did i just scare you you can remov this haze by use meguiar ultim polish compound which i use or equival i have lot of experi with dual action buffer i use gentl pressur on low speed and light agit the surfac with my soft buff foam polish pad work it long enough and you can probabl achiev compar result by hand i follow up with finish glaze gentl hand buff for optim result step 13 now those are some nice smoke tail light congrat so i gave lot of step everyon has their own feedback base on their own experi or lack thereof are all of these step necessari to everyon no but they were how i was taught and my overal desir to make the most out of my 20 00 spent i just recent did full repaint on my 1994 ford bronco eddi bauer that use to be rust bucket no i didn use spray can i use ppg omni urethan automot dual stage paint w my spray gun and achiev great result i wouldn have achiev those result without proper prepar precautionari measur paint is actual the easi part of bodi work so i didn want to throw hurri up half ask job of tail light tint on my otherwis nice look vehicl i am an automot detail and have my share of experi in the field of auto bodi work as well so i am veri picki about how someth look especi when i do the job myself either way you get what you pay for and this is spray can job follow my own knowledg i made the most out of what it is and they turn out rather nice i wouldn recommend more than 2 coat as 3 is too much imo i ve learn from my own mistak and like the other review said your light can be veri hard to see through especi in the day time becaus of it 1 coat offer littl result too light just bare darker than stock and 3 too dark 2 seem just right imo unless you like that realli black look and aren too concern about safeti for yourself and other or if you are do realli light coat make use out of the flash time between coat and do yourself favor and walk away it is far too easi to get sens of urgenc and over excit and want these thing back on your car truck it s much better to wait 5 minut too long than 5 minut too soon and for heaven sake don touch at least not yet tri to do this on day when the air temperatur is at least 65 degre with low relat humid dri warm air work much better to help you than cool moist air tri do this in dust free bug free environ i have too much experi paint in my own garag and for whatev crazi reason bug seem to love the scent of paint materi i actual bought garag door screen to help prevent them from come in yet still provid adequ ventil that s just me though i didn buy it for this purpos i bought it for purpos like this on frequent basi safeti first yet i manag to think of it last if you are realli worri about health wear particul respir and safeti glass i know this is long review and i know everyon has their own opinion on what should shouldn be done the reason i list the tip is for the new to this type of work person that has an interest in undergo this project on their own with littl knowledg on how to do it if you have old beat up light to work with consid replac them befor undergo this project or wet sand with 1500 or even 1000 grit paper and follow up with 1500 2000 grit person i know from experi that the 20 year old tail light on my vehicl that were scratch and scuf didn turn out well i replac them and now i am much more satisfi with the end result one final note the reason it onli get 3 star i promis it s the last thing i ll say for the skeptic what to realli expect if you wet sand with the 2000 grit paper you will like see minor imperfect under the paint clearcoat this is whi i didn do anyth more abras than 2000 grit this will show more promin under direct light instanc and up close inspect this is becaus this tint clear coat realli doesn have ani fill properti like you would expect out of primer with that be said obvious you can prime your work prior to paint in this case so you either have to accept some imperfect or you could go the rout of not wet sand and go straight to paint after good clean but i wouldn do this the reason whi i wouldn is from my own experi when you don do some light scuf the paint tend not to have good adhes at all make it much easier to creat run and or peel in the more immedi futur than the next guy,"[50,

if necessari appli addit coat use onli as direct not for retail unless author littl goe long way so with that i left my car to warm up nice in the sun befor appli the product my car s interior color were mixtur of black and light creme leather i test the product on non conspicu leather spot behind my seat and all was safe it didn chang the color my first impress was the smell it doesn smell horribl but it has smokey smell to it veri hard to describ when appli the smell is veri light and not too appar but out of the bottl it has strong burnt sour chemic smell to it i get the impress they were tri to simul the smell of natur treat leather it will be entir up to you to decid how compat this leather is with your product in case of my car s interior i didn mind it as i believ the smell would mix right in with that new car smell i just wouldn call it pleasant next up applic as i appli the leather honey onto clean microfib cloth to my surpris it was clear as water but thick like syrup even though my car was nice warm up from the sun the product laid down thick there was an immedi tacki as the towel move across the surfac of the leather i can see whi peopl say this product isn oili becaus oil is slipperi when appli still i will be complet straight with you contrari to what other review have state the the product is oili veri oili but not in that slipperi way it leav the leather glisten even as i turn the towel to wipe off the excess the leather was glisten that may be fine for thing like shoe but for car leather especi dashboard it s not good as instruct i left the product on the leather to absorb overnight and on the follow day i went over everyth again with dri towel still my leather was left feel oili and still glisten when i took the car out for drive the spot where my elbow normal touch the window sill was veri hot to the touch as you may or may not know oili thing heat up veri quick ever microwav someth oili like croissant yes it take onli few second anyway remov my elbow it left dull spot i took my dri towel and tri to wipe away the dull spot but it didn go away my elbow had pull the oil right out of the surfac of leather so yes this product is veri oili and terribl choic for car leather i also notic that the smudg left behind on window glass when my towel rub up against it unavoid were not easili wipe away in fact the onli way to get rid of it was to use glass cleaner becaus it is oil base this product is certain capabl of restor dri weather leather the downsid is that it left my car s leather oili i m sure my leather love it but but i didn and it leav slight tacki to the leather that i found veri unapp to sit in summari i can see how this product will rock for maintain shoe and purs which explain the numer posit review but it is not at all good product on leather which your skin touch on regular basi your skin give and absorb oil too and when it touch someth treat with leather honey it will take away some of that oil leather honey is veri thick and oili i laugh now think about the recommend of use brush in the instruct that would have been nightmar to reduc down to an even layer on one hand if you don put enough on it won do ani good for the leather but if you do it s veri veri oili and take mani go over to get thing to an accept state and even after that you re left with tacki unclean feel leather i would not at all recommend this leather product for car or jacket sorri as much as i love the name and the idea behind leather honey i must warn all car lover to steer away from this product i would recommend use zymol s leather creme condition it smell better goe on easi and wipe off without the issu i had with leather honey i end up use it to restor my interior the way it was befor i appli leather honey i realli hope leather honey was better product than what i was use but it wasn at least not for what i bought it for oh yes i did mention jacket didn i yes i appli leather honey to my jacket at the same

the innova 3130c is claim to be full featur diagnost scanner with advanc inform about error code and hint as to how to fix problem it come in nice zipper case with remov odbii cabl and usb cabl plus three aa batteri the includ quick refer guid make no mention of the usb cabl and while the box say that softwar is includ there is no cd or ani indic of where to get the softwar visit innova s site doesn clarifi the mysteri if you go to the download page for the 3130c you are offer onli the full user manual which onli say that softwar is option and link to adob reader the innova web site current show onli the 3130b model and the product pictur show cd hmm rememb that i ve had some product that essenti contain their own softwar i connect the usb cabl to my pc aha window mount pretend cd that had an innova download i ran that and it download the softwar some hint about this in the packag say mention in the quick refer or slip of paper would have been veri welcom i can imagin some purchas might complain that they had an incomplet product sometim later i then decid to go to the 3130b page and it download link the softwar is shown there sigh i see other review had an issu with sd card miss the 3130c i receiv includ the card i first tri the 3130c on my 2013 audi the tool itself identifi the car as volkswagen and had no inform on model etc it could pull up raw data about the engin but did not offer support for enhanc code i then tri on my wife s 2013 honda again it did not identifi the model engin type etc but did claim to support enhanc code but when i ask the tool to retriev those code it said link could not be establish nice featur of the 3130c that my other scanner don have is the abil to record live data for later analysi you can have the tool either record the data when an event occur such as would trigger the check engin light or manual and you can ask it to record the next 100 second previous 100 second or 50 second befor and after you can review some of this data on the tool itself but much more inform is provid if you use the pc link the softwar that get instal is not self contain it link to the innova web site where you must regist an account basic subscript is free and get you limit access to data and assist wherea premium subscript get you more the first time you connect it say you get one month of premium access although neither of my car was show ani code the tool lit the yellow caution light for the honda and flash symbol for the evapor system but it said no code were pend it wasn until i connect the tool to the web site that it then told me that the car hadn yet complet it built in test while it has few thousand mile on it it did just return from dealer visit for recal one not shown in innova s databas so mayb the dealer reset someth the menus and control on the 3130c are confus label and at time i could not figur out how to get to menus such as live data i just kept press button until i got there the download user manual has lot of tutori inform on odbii diagnost capabl and is worth thorough read the 3130c s improv over the 3130b is that it claim to support get inform about ab system it didn work for me on either of my car i note that there is an updat for the 3130b that add this support sinc neither of my car is throw code i couldn test the fix assist technolog though note that you have to connect to their servic from window comput to get this the extend code support is limit to few manufactur and at least for the honda which is claim to be support i m not convinc it realli know anyth for my audi i have vag com cabl from ross tech that connect to laptop and provid far more detail inform and modif abil than the innova of cours this cabl is more expens that the 3130c and is specif to volkswagen audi

some of the actron i have 30 actron i bought from amazon while ago and it is basic but retriev code just as well edit june 1 2013a cowork had car that had an intermitt check engin light so i brought

automat is the smart drive assist that is suppos to help you be more effici driver by monitor your drive qualiti and tell you how to improv in short this is the most expens odb ii code reader you will find that has such limit set of featur i understand what they are tri to do keep it simpl and overal it doe work as advertis i was hope there was more under the hood and discov that it is realli quit limit in the box you get the white automat odb ii code reader dongl if you ve never seen this connector it is like under the dashboard of your car there isn much els in the box other than nice littl sticker you can put on your window to let everyon know you ve got the cool new automat in your car you will also need the iphon app call automat and an iphon 4s or later the reason this won work on an iphon 4 or earlier is becaus it use low power bluetooth protocol not support on the earlier iphon unlik bluetooth headset you don need to pair this with your iphon with the new protocol it just work i instal the automat app on my iphon 5s first it was littl disappoint that it requir me to give my name e mail address and creat an account login to their site to use the app there goe privaci right there whi can it just tell me how i am drive without requir me to be regist on their site when i first plug automat into my car i got nice beep from the devic itself to let me know it was plug in the automat app on my iphon now that i was regist fail to find the devic i tri to plug and unplug few time but eventu i forc close the app doubl click the home button on the iphon and throw away the app and re launch it on re launch it found my dongl onc in the app it is fair simpl when you drive your car it will alert you if you do one of three bad thing hit the brake hard drive over 70 or have hard acceler if that happen small sound will play and your driver score will get ding when you stop the car it will record your distanc mpg and rough estim of the cost of that trip base on current gas price it also will maintain cumul driver score the nice part about the app is that it essenti provid you log of your drive while it run in the background of the iphon so you can look back on your drive histori there is also an engin status page where you can see the status of the engin and read ani code that may be thrown if your car has check engin light it can advis you what is wrong problem with the vapor recoveri system might requir tighten the gas cap yes this can save you trip to the mechan but i m not sure how mani other code are that simpl so whi onli 3 star first i was hope that the drive statist would be more meaning how about graph of my acceler over the trip car effici oxygen sensor etc in fact none of the intern sensor are brought out so i can view them much less log over time all of this data is aggreg into my driver score i can buy reader for my car that cost less than this and will link with my laptop to provid live car readout i get that this isn their target market but they are charg lot more for this than their competit it s just softwar so whi not provid an advanc screen with live engin status readout whi not log speed data it just doesn do that much second there are plenti of highway where the speed limit is abov 70 whi not let me custom this limit this devic is not go to be use in place with higher speed limit third i didn mention it in my review but there is crash assist featur that i am dubious about it say it will get me assist in case of crash use an acceleromet in the devic whi not use the acceleromet in my car or use airbag deploy as proxi how do i know if it is tune right will an accident kick set it off and who monitor the crash system my home alarm system is monitor by ul approv monitor compani general motor has onstar i have no idea what sort of back end system automat has monitor crash alert and what kind of load it can handl not to mention they don know my cell phone number if i am in crash how will the polic contact me how will i let them know it s fals alarm the app and websit are realli spars on this data so conclus in short it doe work if your check engin light is on it will tell you the code and let you reset it but 15 reader will do that it will alert you if you make 3 drive error acceler too fast drive too fast or brake too sudden but even then the drive too fast won let you custom it for the road base on the data they ve given me so far i have littl confid in crash alert it even say beta and i am sore disappoint that for 100 i can view engin status sensor or anyth els in my car at the veri least allow me to log acceler data on the drive 3 star the hardwar seem to work but the softwar has long way to go to justifi the price updat after use this for 2 week go on long car trip and drive through congest citi i am updat this to 2 star as i am remov it from my car and put it away until automat releas serious softwar updat it is beyond useless i drove down i 95 to richmond where the speed limit is 70 as soon as i hit the speed limit it start beep at me veri distract while drive as i said befor if you can even drive the speed limit without get your driver score ding what is the point i also had car in front of me stop short i slam my brake and got beep at again i don know what the folk at automat expect me to do when sudden obstacl is in front of my car but i fear the beep alarm could caus me to get startl and have real accid my hope for this devic were that it would be like the prius in term of driver feedback i don own one but i ve driven one and notic the live readout of your mpg you learn to slowli appli the acceler and how exact to drive to maxim fuel economi it is live readout of everyth that is what automat could have done live readout dure drive instead i get binari decis on 3 factor two of those factor can be violat for normal reason that have noth to do with bad drive habit and the distract alarm could caus real accid the onli feedback i get dure drive itself is rotat icon that let me know drive is in progress serious no other live display meanwhil by hide all engin sensor data there are real thing like dirti air filter and low tire

quick summari review i have both the zubi and the automat test on 2001 old alero use an iphon 5 with ios7pro for zubi the batteri health featur is good and there are more car diagnost this devic isn 8217 bluetooth depend it know what the car is do even when the cell phone isn 8217 there that 8217 s nice for teenag driver or for check on my car when park in airport long term parkingwith automat the app has to be on in the background and the devic will connect to the first user it see if i go on trip with my wife automat might think that she is drive instead of meyou can share driver score and car data with group which is use for parent with teen my kid aren 8217 drive age for coupl of year but when they turn 16 i 8217 ll be look for product that support this pros for automat both cost about the same up front but the zubi has 99 99 annual servic contract becaus it use the cell tower becaus automat use the cell phone for all transmiss you onli have to pay onc big plusth automat app is easier to navigatewith zubi the car is assign to driver all trip on the car will go to the assign driver regardless of who is actual drive the car you must activ chang the activ driver for the car which is actual pretti easi to do but easi to mess up there is no way to 8220 fix 8221 who the actual driver was after the fact crash alert the devic will alert pre defin contact and even an automat agent in case crash is detect gas price it show an estim gas spent base on averag fuel price in the area right now this function is limit becaus it assum grade of gas and can 8217 be custom to what i actual paid for it it would be great if it knew i use 87 octan gas when i fuel up and what the price was at that station it has audibl feedback when you hard brake hard acceler or exceed speed these can be turn on or off but can 8217 be tune for exampl colorado has post 75 speed limit so exceed fix 70mph threshold isn 8217 valuabl car locat track this should be pro for zubi i 8217 m pay 99 99 year almost precis for this reason howev time after time zubi think my car is block away at neighbor hous when it is clear park in my garag my cell phone are all proper detect in my hous but yet zubi think my car is block away that make car locat track useless automat know where my car is as long as i have my phone with me which i alway do both the same both product have limit function on 2001 alero my car just doesn 8217 send all of the signal that new car doe i e fuel gage level mpg neither product has good web interfac where you can set up your account view metric data etc 8230 conclus if i didn 8217 have smart phone for my famili that i was alreadi pay 150 month for i 8217 d be more posit for the zubi that be said i do have smart phone my smartphon and automat combin can do 95 of what zubi and zubi app can do car locat track famili track drive stat engin health and it can do sever thing that zubi can 8217 audibl feedback crash alert the 2 thing that zubi can do that automat can 8217 onli batteri health is desir the other track without cell phone is unnecessari for me sinc i have 2 car i 8217 d end up pay 200 year vs 200 onc to use zubi that 8217 s too much money for what is current offer they need to find way to either reduc the cost or offer 2 tier product for those who don 8217 have cell phone they state numer time that they don 8217 make money off of the cell servic so they should find way to elimin it or make it option detail experi reviewth quick start instruct were easi to follow first i download the app to the phone when i first open the app i was ask to creat an account i was given the option to log in from facebook which made the log in easi i was then prompt to creat group which allow share featur i set up mine for my famili i then follow the instruct to activ the zubi key i like that it use barcod scan to detect the zubi key and activ code it took about minut to get my phone angl correct to detect the 2 d barcod but it work it even detect by vin barcod for my car howev i receiv an email about 10 minut later say by vin barcod was invalid so i had to manual enter it my famili can be in my group without the app but the valu is more limit it doe detect their locat like find my friend you can turn off locat track within the app perman switch or temporarili up to 2 day sinc i am use this with my famili i will leav the locat track on we have noth to hide i took the car for drive around the block and when i came back home i look at the stat for some reason my car is shown park block away from my hous not anywher near where i was drive this happen lot i don 8217 have lot of confid in be abl to find my car when it say my car is 1 2 block away from realiti big minus i 8217 ve gone on sever more drive and i must say that the phone user
