mode and that s too mani volt for some agm batteri and it caus his to outga reduc the batteri s life my optima yellow top agm batteri is rate for 15v charg so i thought this charger would be okay for it but the charger i got put out 15 5v i did find spec that say 15 6v regul voltag is okay for rapid charg on my batteri but they don defin what rapid charg mean they do say with 15 6v to charg until current drop below 1 amp which i think mean you can do 15 6v until the batteri get closer to be charg and stop accept high amperag unfortun this charger doe the exact opposit start at lower voltag and increas to 15 5v around when it decid the batteri is at 90 charg which seem to equat to about 12 6 or 12 7v on my batteri the charger keep output 15 5v until the batteri is fulli charg which may take hour so it seem unlik that s good for most batteri and i m pretti sure it s against the charg spec on my batteri note that the charger show 15 4v on it readout but my volt meter show it s actual 15 5v nevertheless i let it keep do 15 5v and check period to make sure the batteri wasn hot it never even felt warm and an ir temperatur gun read 86f max and wasn hiss hiss would mean it was overcharg and releas gas perman reduc it life it took almost exact 12 hour for the charger to decid it was 100 charg and go into mainten mode but when it did it pick 12 4v agm batteri are suppos to be charg at around 13 6v for mainten float charg so i have no idea whi it pick 12 4v i left it on for anoth hour and it actual reduc the voltag to 12 3 at which point i took it off the charger volt meter said the batteri was at 12 31v i can decid if this charger is broken has weird charg algorithm or is actual veri smart i say that becaus my batteri was discharg to about 3 5v few week ago well below the voltag it s design to be discharg to it s deep cycl but even deep cycl don toler discharg below 50 and even below 10 5v may hurt them so it s now damag and won hold the full 13 6v it s suppos to instead if i leav it on the charger at 15 5v for an hour it hit 12 8v and then quick lose charg to 12 5v in about 30 minut so mayb the charger somehow figur that out and decid that 12 4v was full charg on my damag batteri so that s what it use as it float charg i don see how it could determin that if the batteri was 12 8v or higher after the long 15 5v charg but who know i also don know if 15 4v is realli bad for my batteri or for the averag agm i spent awhil research but couldn find ani real authorit inform just bunch of peopl theoriz sinc it s abov the 15v standard charg on the batteri spec sheet i don think it s good thing but then again i also found research nrel dot gov vehiclesandfuel energystorag pdfs evs17pr pdf show that serious overvolt yellow top batteri to 17v under certain condit actual increas it life so i don know what to think but i m lean toward think it s bad thing to go against the manufactur s spec sheet unless you re in lab use special charger what i do know is that the desulfin featur on this charger didn do thing for my damag batteri in fact i don think it even kick in i connect the charger to small seal lead acid batteri that i left unus for too long and it went into desulfin mode i think the manual doesn say how you re suppos to know for over 8 hour pump 16 8v into the batteri until it said bad bat on it screen and stop charg in all that time the batteri never show over 15 charg on the charger though it did end up hold about 10 9v in my onlin research it was mention in few place that there are no studi show desulfin actual work so i m pretti dubious about it it definit didn work on either of my batteri it was also interest to note that the seal lead acid batteri never got warm which i find rather curious consid how long it was put in such high voltag i had the charger connect to kill watt meter and it show the charger was pull onli 0 15amp and 9watt and this is in 2amp charg mode so mayb the charger is smart enough to use low amperag when it s use high voltag and that prevent the batteri from get damag when it was push 15 4v to my agm batteri it was onli draw 0 35amp and it actual reduc the amp to 0 29 as it got closer to 100 charg so mayb that protect the batteri from overvoltag damag but i don know enough to be sure mayb batteri expert will chime in in the comment anoth import thing to consid is that desulfin mode could damag your car s electron if you don remov the batteri from the car to charg it 16 8v is more than most car were design to handl and i found someon mention that bmw warn not to use charger that do thing like that so it s definit concern i don know if i feel comfort use this charger again without remov the batteri from the car some charger claim to somehow magic detect the presenc of car electron and limit their voltag but this charger say noth about that in it manual other than all that the design of the charger is nice wire fit into pocket beneath the retract handl it will show you the batteri voltag on it readout until you tell it to start charg although it read 0 1 to 0 2v lower than my volt meter which is annoy button let you toggl between display of voltag or batteri percent it let you choos standard agm and gel cell and choos from three rate of charg the slower 2a charg rate is suppos to be better for mani batteri so use 2a or 6a if you aren in hurri i tri both those mode and it still put out 15 5v in 6a mode but it put out 15 3v in 2a mode sinc this is dedic 12v charger you don have to worri about it autodetect actual auto misdetect your discharg 12v batteri as 6v and never charg it past 6v which is problem with far too mani charger these day despit it nice control and smart form factor i give this charger low rate becaus i think it tri to push some batteri beyond their limit in the name of charg them as quick or as fulli as possibl one review said it caus his agm to outga and anoth said it burnt out his batteri after few month of trickl charg mode if you have the

befor appli the product my car s interior color were mixtur of black and light creme leather i test the product on non conspicu leather spot behind my seat and all was safe it didn chang the color my first impress was the smell it doesn smell horribl but it has smokey smell to it veri hard to describ when appli the smell is veri light and not too appar but out of the bottl it has strong burnt sour chemic smell to it i get the impress they were tri to simul the smell of natur treat leather it will be entir up to you to decid how compat this leather is with your product in case of my car s interior i didn mind it as i believ the smell would mix right in with that new car smell i just wouldn call it pleasant next up applic as i appli the leather honey onto clean microfib cloth to my surpris it was clear as water but thick like syrup even though my car was nice warm up from the sun the product laid down thick there was an immedi tacki as the towel move across the surfac of the leather i can see whi peopl say this product isn oili becaus oil is slipperi when appli still i will be complet straight with you contrari to what other review have state the the product is oili veri oili but not in that slipperi way it leav the leather glisten even as i turn the towel to wipe off the excess the leather was glisten that may be fine for thing like shoe but for car leather especi dashboard it s not good as instruct i left the product on the leather to absorb overnight and on the follow day i went over everyth again with dri towel still my leather was left feel oili and still glisten when i took the car out for drive the spot where my elbow normal touch the window sill was veri hot to the touch as you may or may not know oili thing heat up veri quick ever microwav someth oili like croissant yes it take onli few second anyway remov my elbow it left dull spot i took my dri towel and tri to wipe away the dull spot but it didn go away my elbow had pull the oil right out of the surfac of leather so yes this product is veri oili and terribl choic for car leather i also notic that the smudg left behind on window glass when my towel rub up against it unavoid were not easili wipe away in fact the onli way to get rid of it was to use glass cleaner becaus it is oil base this product is certain capabl of restor dri weather leather the downsid is that it left my car s leather oili i m sure my leather love it but but i didn and it leav slight tacki to the leather that i found veri unapp to sit in summari i can see how this product will rock for maintain shoe and purs which explain the numer posit review but it is not at all good product on leather which your skin touch on regular basi your skin give and absorb oil too and when it touch someth treat with leather honey it will take away some of that oil leather honey is veri thick and oili i laugh now think about the recommend of use brush in the instruct that would have been nightmar to reduc down to an even layer on one hand if you don put enough on it won do ani good for the leather but if you do it s veri veri oili and take mani go over to get thing to an accept state and even after that you re left with tacki unclean feel leather i would not at all recommend this leather product for car or jacket sorri as much as i love the name and the idea behind leather honey i must warn all car lover to steer away from this product i would recommend use zymol s leather creme condition it smell better goe on easi and wipe off without the issu i had with leather honey i end up use it to restor my interior the way it was befor i appli leather honey i realli hope leather honey was better product than what i was use but it wasn at least not for what i bought it for oh yes i did mention jacket didn i yes i appli leather honey to my jacket at the same time it was mistak it too was left feel slight tacki it was an 800 levi s made and craft leather motorcycl style jacket like babi s butt

can put on your window to let everyon know you ve got the cool new automat in your car you will also need the iphon app call automat and an iphon 4s or later the reason this won work on an iphon 4 or earlier is becaus it use low power bluetooth protocol not support on the earlier iphon unlik bluetooth headset you don need to pair this with your iphon with the new protocol it just work i instal the automat app on my iphon 5s first it was littl disappoint that it requir me to give my name e mail address and creat an account login to their site to use the app there goe privaci right there whi can it just tell me how i am drive without requir me to be regist on their site when i first plug automat into my car i got nice beep from the devic itself to let me know it was plug in the automat app on my iphon now that i was regist fail to find the devic i tri to plug and unplug few time but eventu i forc close the app doubl click the home button on the iphon and throw away the app and re launch it on re launch it found my dongl onc in the app it is fair simpl when you drive your car it will alert you if you do one of three bad thing hit the brake hard drive over 70 or have hard acceler if that happen small sound will play and your driver score will get ding when you stop the car it will record your distanc mpg and rough estim of the cost of that trip base on current gas price it also will maintain cumul driver score the nice part about the app is that it essenti provid you log of your drive while it run in the background of the iphon so you can look back on your drive histori there is also an engin status page where you can see the status of the engin and read ani code that may be thrown if your car has check engin light it can advis you what is wrong problem with the vapor recoveri system might requir tighten the gas cap yes this can save you trip to the mechan but i m not sure how mani other code are that simpl so whi onli 3 star first i was hope that the drive statist would be more meaning how about graph of my acceler over the trip car effici oxygen sensor etc in fact none of the intern sensor are brought out so i can view them much less log over time all of this data is aggreg into my driver score i can buy reader for my car that cost less than this and will link with my laptop to provid live car readout i get that this isn their target market but they are charg lot more for this than their competit it s just softwar so whi not provid an advanc screen with live engin status readout whi not log speed data it just doesn do that much second there are plenti of highway where the speed limit is abov 70 whi not let me custom this limit this devic is not go to be use in place with higher speed limit third i didn mention it in my review but there is crash assist featur that i am dubious about it say it will get me assist in case of crash use an acceleromet in the devic whi not use the acceleromet in my car or use airbag deploy as proxi how do i know if it is tune right will an accident kick set it off and who monitor the crash system my home alarm system is monitor by ul approv monitor compani general motor has onstar i have no idea what sort of back end system automat has monitor crash alert and what kind of load it can handl not to mention they don know my cell phone number if i am in crash how will the polic contact me how will i let them know it s fals alarm the app and websit are realli spars on this data so conclus in short it doe work if your check engin light is on it will tell you the code and let you reset it but 15 reader will do that it will alert you if you make 3 drive error acceler too fast drive too fast or brake too sudden but even then the drive too fast won let you custom it for the road base on the data they ve given me so far i have littl confid in crash alert it even say beta and i am sore disappoint that for 100 i can view engin status sensor or anyth els in my car at the veri least allow me to log acceler data on the drive 3 star the hardwar seem to work but the softwar has long way to go to justifi the price updat after use this for 2 week go on long car trip and drive through congest citi i am updat this to 2 star as i am remov it from my car and put it away until automat releas serious softwar updat it is beyond useless i drove down i 95 to richmond where the speed limit is 70 as soon as i hit the speed limit it start beep at me veri distract while drive as i said befor if you can even drive the speed limit without get your driver score ding what is the point i also had car in front of me stop short i slam my brake and got beep at again i don know what the folk at automat expect me to do when sudden obstacl is in front of my car but i fear the beep alarm could caus me to

to slowli appli the acceler and how exact to drive to maxim fuel economi it is live readout of everyth that is what automat could have done live readout dure drive instead i get binari decis on 3 factor two of those factor can be violat for normal reason that have noth to do with bad drive habit and the distract alarm could caus real accid the onli feedback i get dure drive itself is rotat
